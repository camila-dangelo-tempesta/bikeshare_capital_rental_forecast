## 1. BUSINESS PROBLEMS

This experiment aims to demonstrate the process of building a regression model to predict the demand for bicycle rental. Where, the objective will be to predict the value of the variable cnt (count) that represents the amount of rented bicycles and whose objective within a specific hour range is from 1 to 977.

We will use a dataset to build and train our model.

The  dataset ["Bike Rental UCI"](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset) will be used to build and train the model in this experiment.

This dataset is based on real data from the company Capital Bikeshare, which operates bicycle rentals in the city of WashingtonDC, USA.

***
## 2. BUSINESS ASSUMPTIONS

The dataset contains 17,379 observations and 17 variables, representing the number of bikes rented within specific hours of the day, in the years 2011 and 2012. Weather conditions (such as temperature, humidity and wind speed) were included in the dataset and the dates were categorized such as holidays and weekdays.

### 2.1 **Assumptions:** 

- This code contains commands to filter and transform the bike rental data,
- This code was created to run on both Azure and RStudio;
- To run on Azure, change the value of the Azure variable to TRUE;
- That is, if the value is FALSE, the code will be executed in RStudio;
