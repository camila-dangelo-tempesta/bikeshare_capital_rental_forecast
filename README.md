## 1. BUSINESS PROBLEMS

### 1.1 Summary

This experiment aims to create a predictive model for estimate the demand for bicycle rental.

### 1.2 Description

This experiment aims to demonstrate the process of building a model regression model to predict the demand for bicycle rentals. We will use a dataset to build and train our model.

### 1.3 Objective

The objective will be to predict the value of the variable cnt (count) that represents the number of bicycles rented within a specific time and whose range is from 1 to 977.

## 2. Data

The [Bike Rental UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset) dataset will be used to build and train the model in this experiment. This dataset is based on real company data Capital Bikeshare, which operates bike rentals in the city of Washington DC, In the USA.

The dataset contains 17,379 observations and 17 variables, representing the number of bicycles rented within specific hours of the day, in the years of 2011 and 2012. Weather conditions (such as temperature, humidity and speed of wind) were included in the dataset and the dates were categorized as holidays and days of the week.

 - **Bike Sharing Dataset Data Set**: This dataset contains the hourly and daily count of rental bikes between years 2011 and 2012 in Capital bikeshare system with the corresponding weather and seasonal information.
